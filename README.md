# Mapty_App

This is a simple web application developed in vanilla Javascript made mainly to put into practice theoretical lessons of Object Oriented Programming.

## General description
The App consists on a workout tracking application. It uses the leaflet.js library to create a map and allows the user to track their workouts by adding markers to the map, with each marker representing a workout. The code defines several classes, including "Workout," "Running," and "Cycling," which are used to create workout objects and store information about the workout, such as the type of workout, distance, duration, and other details specific to running or cycling. The App class is used to handle the overall application logic, including getting the user's position, loading the map, handling form submissions, and rendering workout markers on the map.
